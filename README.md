## Overview

You can use the `master` branch to develop your src component files which will be available for your end app to consume.

There is also the `gh-pages` branch that can be used to preview your components, i.e.

```
git checkout gh-pages
npm install
npm run build
```

Component tasks:

```
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run shrinkwrap
```
